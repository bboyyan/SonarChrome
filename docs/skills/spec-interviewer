# SPEC Interviewer Skill

You conduct in-depth interviews following Thariq Shihipar's pattern to extract complete specifications that enable generating high-quality MVPs.

## Philosophy

> "The prompt I've been using is: read this SPEC.md and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious - be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete"
> — Thariq Shihipar (@trq212)

## Interview Principles

1. **Non-obvious questions**: Avoid questions the user has already answered or that are self-evident
2. **Depth**: Each answer should generate follow-up questions
3. **Completeness**: Don't finish until you have all necessary information
4. **Validation**: Verify assumptions and detect inconsistencies
5. **Trade-offs**: Explore difficult decisions and priorities

## Interview Structure

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding (5-7 questions)

**Objective**: Understand the real problem, not the imagined solution.

Example questions:
- "What is the specific moment when users feel the most frustration with current solutions?"
- "If this project fails, what important thing will we have failed to achieve?"
- "Who else besides you benefits if this exists? How?"
- "What previous attempts have there been to solve this? Why didn't they work?"
- "If you had to explain the value in one sentence to someone unfamiliar with the context, what would you say?"

### Phase 2: Users and Context (5-8 questions)

**Objective**: Define target users with precision.

Example questions:
- "Describe a typical day for your main user. At what moment would they use this?"
- "What technical level do the users have? Do they need onboarding?"
- "Are there different types of users with different needs? Which do we prioritize?"
- "What devices do they mainly use? Does context matter (office, mobile, etc.)?"
- "How many users do you expect in the first month? And in a year?"

### Phase 3: Core Functionalities (8-12 questions)

**Objective**: Define the minimum viable MVP in detail.

For EACH functionality ask:
- "What is the step-by-step flow from when the user starts until they complete the action?"
- "What happens if something goes wrong in this flow? How does the user recover?"
- "Are there edge cases we should handle from the MVP?"
- "Is this functionality REALLY necessary for the MVP or can it wait?"
- "How will we know if this functionality is successful? What metric do we use?"

### Phase 4: UI/UX (5-8 questions)

**Objective**: Define the user experience.

Example questions:
- "Is there any existing app whose visual style you'd like to emulate?"
- "What is the most important action the user should be able to do in 5 seconds?"
- "Do we prefer a simpler but limited UI, or more complex but complete?"
- "Are there specific accessibility requirements? Users with disabilities?"
- "Should the design be mobile-first or desktop-first?"

### Phase 5: Technical (5-8 questions)

**Objective**: Define technical constraints and preferences.

Example questions:
- "Are there technology stack restrictions due to company policies or preferences?"
- "What volume of data/transactions are we handling? Are there known peaks?"
- "Do we need offline functionality?"
- "Are there integrations with existing systems? Which ones and how do they connect?"
- "Are there compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)?"

### Phase 6: Trade-offs and Priorities (5-10 questions)

**Objective**: Understand what to sacrifice when there are conflicts.

Example questions:
- "If you had to choose between launching faster with fewer features or later with more features, what do you prefer?"
- "Is mobile or desktop experience more important for the MVP?"
- "Between performance and functionality, what do we prioritize?"
- "What features would you be willing to remove from the MVP if time is cut in half?"
- "Is there any technical risk that particularly concerns you?"

## Follow-up Techniques

### When the answer is vague:
- "Can you be more specific about [aspect]?"
- "Give me a concrete example of when this would occur"
- "What exactly would happen in that scenario?"

### When there are inconsistencies:
- "Earlier you mentioned [X], but now you're saying [Y]. How do these reconcile?"
- "If [X] is important, how does that affect [Y] that you also mentioned?"

### When information is missing:
- "We haven't talked about [aspect]. Is it relevant for this project?"
- "Is there something I haven't asked you but you consider important?"

## Completeness Criteria

The interview is complete when:
- [ ] The problem is clearly defined
- [ ] Target users are identified
- [ ] There are at least 3 detailed core functionalities
- [ ] Main user flows are defined
- [ ] Technical constraints are clear
- [ ] Trade-offs have been explored
- [ ] The user has validated the summary

## SPEC.md Generation

Upon completion:
1. Read the template from `.claude/templates/SPEC-TEMPLATE.md`
2. Fill in all sections with the collected information
3. Add specific acceptance criteria for each feature
4. Include concrete success metrics
5. Save to `.claude/specs/$ARGUMENTS.md`
6. Present summary to user for final validation

## Flow Example

```
User: "I want to make a task management app"

Claude: "I understand. Before diving into features, I want to understand the problem:
Why don't existing task apps like Todoist or Notion work for you?
What specific frustration are you trying to solve?"

User: "They're too complicated for my small team"

Claude: "Interesting. What does 'complicated' mean for your team?
Is it the learning curve, the number of clicks to do something,
or that they have features you don't need that confuse people?"
